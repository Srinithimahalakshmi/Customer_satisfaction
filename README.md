##  Overview
A machine learning project aimed at predicting customer satisfaction levels using structured data. The system involves preprocessing, feature engineering, and comparison across models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and more‚Äîwith insightful visualizations included.

---

##  Features
-  Clean and preprocess customer data  
-  Extract relevant features for modeling  
-  Compare performance across models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost  
-  Visualize model results with confusion matrices and performance reports  
-  Jupyter notebooks for analysis and experimentation

##  Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Srinithimahalakshmi/Customer_satisfaction.git
cd Customer_satisfaction

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## Usage

### 1. Run Data Analysis & Training

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Explore preprocessing steps, train multiple models, and visualize results directly in the notebooks.

### 2. Execute Model Scripts

```bash
python train_model.py
python evaluate_model.py
```

Use these scripts (if they exist) to train models and generate metrics from the command line.
